Introduction

Scope of this Primer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document is meant as a first introduction to the Citation Style Language
(CSL) and is primarily aimed at those who wish to create or modify CSL styles.
Some prior knowledge of XML or HTML will come in handy. If these terms are
unfamiliar to you, check out one of the many online introductions to XML, e.g.
the one at http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp.

What is CSL?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Citation Style Language (CSL) is an open and free [#]_ XML based language
for writing CSL styles, which describe how citations and bibliographies should
be formatted. Citing plays an important role in academic literature: it can be
used for attribution (which is important to avoid plagiarism), to give context
to your research, and to eliminate the need to repeat previously published
results.

Unfortunately, correctly citing is often far from trivial. Style guides like the
*American Psychological Association (APA) Style*, *The Chicago Manual of Style*
or the *MLA Style* dedicate many pages to citation formatting. To complicate
things further, many academic journals use proprietary styles that deviate from
these 'generic' citation styles.

The Citation Style Language was designed to make citing easier. When CSL styles
are used in combination with CSL compatible reference management software (such
as Zotero or Mendeley), citations and bibliographies can be automatically
generated according to the style of preference [#]_. You can quickly switch
between styles (e.g. if a manuscript has to be submitted to a different
scientific journal). Finally, terms, date formats, and punctuation rules used
for citations and bibliographies can be changed at a whim to follow one of 38
different locales (ranging from Afrikaans to Hebrew to Vietnamese).

       <http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/06/thomson-reuters-suit-against-zotero-software-dismissed.ars>`_!
       We promise!

Different Classes of Citation Styles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before we leap into the world of CSL, let's take a look at the different types
of citation styles that are in use. Citation styles can be divided in two
groups:

A) **"in-text"** styles: when a work is cited, a *citation* is added to the
   sentence. The citation points directly to a corresponding bibliographic entry
   in the bibliography.
   
   Various types of "in-text" styles exist. The main types are:

   - **"author-date"** and **"author"** styles
     
     *Sentence* [#]_
     
     Yeast cells were grown at 25°C in batch cultures on 0.5% methanol for 36
     hours (Gidijala et al. 2008) or in carbon-limited chemostat cultures (van
     der Klei et al. 1991; Zwart et al. 1983). (author-date)

B) **"note"** styles: when a work is cited, a *marker* is added to the sentence.
   The marker, which can be a number or a symbol, points to a foot or endnote.
   In contrast to in-text citations, foot or endnotes typically contain all
   information required to locate the cited work(s). Optionally, the cited works
   can also be included in a bibliography. An example of a note style [#]_:
   
    "In the Island of St. Kilda, according to Martin, [*]_ the men do not
    acquire beards until the age of thirty or upwards, and even then the beards
    are very thin. On the Europæo-Asiatic continent, beards prevail until we
    pass beyond India; though with the natives of Ceylon they are often absent,
    as was noticed in ancient times by Diodorus. [*]_"
    
    .. [*] 'Voyage to St. Kilda' (3rd edit. 1753), p. 37.
    .. [*] Sir J. E. Tennent, 'Ceylon,' vol. ii. 1859, p. 107.

          relation to sex. London: John Murray. 2d ed., 15th thousand, available

It is not uncommon for in-text citations or foot and endnotes to include
references to multiple works. In CSL jargon, the entire in-text citation or note
is called the "citation". A "citation" that references multiple works contains
multiple "cites", with each "cite" referencing a single work. Similarly, the
"bibliography" consists of "bibliographic entries", one for each cited work.
