Introduction
------------

**Temporary Notice: the changes listed below are still in flux, and only will
become definite with the actual release of CSL 1.0.1. Please give feedback via
the referenced issue tickets, the |link| `xbiblio mailing list
<https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xbiblio-devel>`_, or the Zotero
forums.**

This document describes the changes introduced with version 1.0.1 of the
Citation Style Language (CSL), as compared to the CSL 1.0 schema and the
2010-05-30 update of the CSL 1.0 specification. For full details on how to use
new features, see the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

CSL 1.0.1 is a backwards compatible release, meaning that any valid CSL 1.0
style should validate against the CSL 1.0.1 schema and work with any CSL
1.0.1-compatible CSL processor.

Specification
-------------

The CSL specification has been largely rewritten for improved precision and
clarity. There are several new paragraphs (e.g., |link| `Terminology
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#terminology>`_ and
|link| `File Types
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#file-types>`_), and
every `CSL variable
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#appendix-i-variables>`_
is now accompanied by a short description.

Style Metadata
--------------

eISSN
~~~~~

Previously, the ``cs:issn`` and ``cs:issnl`` elements could already be used to
indicate respectively the different ISSNs for journal-specific styles (e.g. of
the print and online editions), and the journal's ISSN-L. The new optional
``cs:eissn`` element allows the ISSN of the online edition (the eISSN) to be
explictly specified, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <info>
      <title>Applied and Environmental Microbiology</title>
      <issn>0099-2240</issn>
      <eissn>1098-5336</eissn>
    </info>

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/74f6a4c75c0296a754d60aab0d127541d4c485a4

License
~~~~~~~

The ``cs:rights`` element may now carry a "license" attribute to indicate the
URI of the style license, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <info>
      <rights license="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">This work
      is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported
      License</rights>
    </info>

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/912ec31e3572d2b4ba4693bb4d83af3811af7509

Links
~~~~~

The CSL schema has become more strict about the use of the "rel" attribute on
``cs:link``. The values "independent-parent" and "template" are now only allowed
for dependent and independent styles, respectively.

Short Title
~~~~~~~~~~~

The new optional ``cs:title-short`` element can be used to give a shortened
style title, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <info>
      <title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</title>
      <title-short>PNAS</title-short>
    </info>

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/66636d2bee489400d8eb375640f0a2336dfc0f95

Different Attributes on ``cs:style`` for Dependent and Independent Styles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For dependent styles, ``cs:style`` may no longer carry the "default-locale"
attribute or any of the global options (the "demote-non-dropping-particle",
"initialize-with-hyphen", and "page-range-format" attributes) and inheritable
name options, whereas the "class" attribute has become optional (while "class"
has no function in dependent styles, it will only be disallowed in the next
backward incompatible CSL release, as it's a required attribute for CSL 1.0
styles).

Gender-specific Ordinals
------------------------

It is now possible to define feminine, masculine and neuter variants of ordinal
suffixes, and specify the gender of the relevant noun CSL variables. For
example, this allows for automatic localization of the English "1st" and "first"
in French to "1er" and "premier" if the target noun is masculine (e.g., "1er
janvier" for "January 1st"), and "1re" and "première" if the noun is feminine
(e.g., "1re édition" for "1st edition"). See |link| `Gender-specific Ordinals
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#gender-specific-ordinals>`_
for details.

Names
-----

Et-al Delimiter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, the "et-al" and "and others" terms were preceded by a space when
rendered as a result of et-al abbreviation. The new optional
"delimiter-precedes-et-al" attribute for ``cs:name`` allows the name delimiter
to be used instead (e.g. "Doe, et al. 2000" instead of "Doe et al. 2000"), with
control options similar to "delimiter-precedes-last".

See also |link| `Name <http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#name>`_.

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/45f934d446849c394c4b5dbf0f3c9188f176ab98

Et-al Abbreviation with Last Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By using the new "et-al-use-last" attribute for ``cs:name``, it is now possible
to use et-al abbreviation and show the last author (as required by the 6th
edition of the APA style). In this case an ellipsis, preceded by the name
delimiter, replaces the "et-al" or "and others" term, e.g.:

::

    A. Goffeau, B. G. Barrell, H. Bussey, R. W. Davis, B. Dujon, H. Feldmann, â€¦
    S. G. Oliver

The accompanying "names-use-last" attribute for ``cs:key`` can be used to
override the value of "et-al-use-last" for sorting.

See also http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#name.

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/f1407079ec0f53ae58cb70000139a38651366e87

Affixes on Name-parts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "prefix" and "suffix" attributes are now also allowed on ``cs:name-part``,
allowing for name formatting like "DOE (Jane)".

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/48c9abe5d7c917114e96d5b3068c803693e09841

``cs:name`` Optional
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cs:name`` element is no longer a required child element of ``cs:names``.

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/cab0cc6fae60771bfe9638d471f4f1bc4c75b4bf

Independent "name-min" and "names-use-first"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CSL schema now allows the "name-min" and "names-use-first" attributes to be
set independently on ``cs:key``.

https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/commit/f1407079ec0f53ae58cb70000139a38651366e87

Variables
---------

Using ``cs:label`` with Number Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cs:label`` element, which previously could only be used for the "locator"
and "page" variables (and name variables, when used as a child element of
``cs:names``), can now also be used with any `number variable
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#number-variables>`_.

Ticket(s):

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/8

Dedicated Variables "title" and "container-title" abbreviations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, "title" and "container-title" abbreviations were only accessible
through the "short" forms of these variables. As a result, it was impossible to
specifically test whether an abbreviation existed (``<if variable="title"/>``
tests "true" whenever a "long" or "short" form of "title" exists).

Now, these abbreviations can also be accessed through the dedicated
"title-short" and "container-title-short" variables. For example,

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <choose>
      <if variable="title-short">
        <group delimiter=" ">
          <text variable="title-short"/>
          <text variable="title" prefix="(" suffix=")"/>
        </group>
      </if>
      <else>
        <text variable="title"/>
      </else>
    </choose>

would give title listings like:

The Hobbit (The Hobbit, or There and Back Again)
Lord of the Rings
Free Culture (Free Culture: The Nature and Future of Creativity)

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/2

More Number Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CSL variables "chapter-number", "collection-number" and "number-of-pages",
which previously were standard variables, have now become number variables. As a
result, they can now be rendered through either ``cs:number`` or ``cs:text``.

Ticket(s):

- https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/9

Line Spacing
------------

The minimum value for line spacing has been increased to "1".

cite-group-delimiter
--------------------


Input Data Model
----------------

The `CSL schema <https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema>`_ GitHub
repository now contains a JSON schema describing the CSL input data model
(csl-data.json, and, to describe the citation objects that are embedded in word
processor documents, csl-citation.json). At this point, it is modeled on the
input model used by citeproc-js. The schemas are not necessarily incomplete and
aren't normative.
