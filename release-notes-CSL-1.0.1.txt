Introduction
------------

**Temporary Notice: the changes listed below are still in flux, and only will
become definite with the actual release of CSL 1.0.1. Please give feedback via
the referenced issue tickets, the |link| `xbiblio mailing list
<https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xbiblio-devel>`_, or the Zotero
forums.**

This document describes the changes introduced with version 1.0.1 of the
Citation Style Language (CSL), as compared to the CSL 1.0 schema and the
2010-05-30 update of the CSL 1.0 specification. For full details on how to use
new features, see the CSL 1.0.1 specification.

CSL 1.0.1 is a backwards compatible release, meaning that any valid CSL 1.0
style should validate against the CSL 1.0.1 schema and work with any CSL
1.0.1-compatible CSL processor.

Cite Grouping
-------------

In in-text citations, cites with indentical names are often grouped, e.g. "(Doe
2001, 2004; Smith 2002)" instead of "(Doe 2001, Smith 2002, Doe 2004)". For CSL,
we refer to this as "cite grouping".

While cite grouping already existed for cites that were collapsed (e.g. "(Doe
2001, 2004; Smith 2002)"), cites can now also be grouped without collapsing.

A new attribute for ``cs:citation``, ``cite-group-delimiter``, allows a custom
delimiter to be set for cites in a group. Whenever this attribute or the
"collapse" attribute is used, cite grouping is activated. With
``cite-group-delimiter``, it is now possible to generate citations like "(Doe
2001, Doe 2004; Smith 2002; Anderson 2005)". See also |link|
`http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#cite-grouping`_

Disambiguation
--------------

The default value of ``givenname-disambiguation-rule`` has been changed from
"all-names" to "by-cite". The latter is a less aggressive disambiguation method
that is limited to ambiguous cites.

Gender-specific Ordinals
------------------------

It is now possible to define feminine, masculine and neuter variants of ordinal
suffixes, and specify the gender of the relevant noun CSL variables. For
example, this allows for automatic localization of the English "1st" and "first"
in French to "1er" and "premier" if the target noun is masculine (e.g., "1er
janvier" for "January 1st"), and "1re" and "première" if the noun is feminine
(e.g., "1re édition" for "1st edition"). See |link| `Gender-specific Ordinals
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#gender-specific-ordinals>`_
for details.

Input Data Model
----------------

The |link| `CSL schema <https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema>`_
GitHub repository now contains a JSON schema describing the CSL input data model
(csl-data.json, and, to describe the citation objects that are embedded in word
processor documents, csl-citation.json). At this point, it is modeled on the
input model used by citeproc-js. The schemas are not necessarily incomplete and
aren't normative.

Line Spacing
------------

The minimum value for line spacing has been increased to "1".

Names
-----

Affixes on Name-parts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``prefix`` and ``suffix`` attributes are now also allowed on
``cs:name-part``, allowing for name formatting like "DOE (Jane)".

Ticket(s):

- |link| https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/47

``cs:name`` Optional
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cs:name`` element is no longer a required child element of ``cs:names``.

- |link| https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/53

Et-al Abbreviation with Last Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By using the new ``et-al-use-last`` attribute for ``cs:name``, it is now
possible to use et-al abbreviation and show the last author (as required by the
6th edition of the APA style). In this case an ellipsis, preceded by the name
delimiter, replaces the "et-al" or "and others" term, e.g.:

::

    A. Goffeau, B. G. Barrell, H. Bussey, R. W. Davis, B. Dujon, H. Feldmann, …
    S. G. Oliver

The accompanying ``names-use-last`` attribute for ``cs:key`` can be used to
override the value of ``et-al-use-last`` for sorting.

See also |link| http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#name.

Ticket(s):

- |link| https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/11

Et-al Delimiter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, the "et-al" and "and others" terms were preceded by a space when
rendered as a result of et-al abbreviation. The new optional
``delimiter-precedes-et-al`` attribute for ``cs:name`` allows the name delimiter
to be used instead (e.g. "Doe, et al. 2000" instead of "Doe et al. 2000"), with
control options similar to ``delimiter-precedes-last``.

See also |link| `Name <http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#name>`_.

- |link| https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/12

Independent ``name-min`` and ``names-use-first``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CSL schema now allows the ``name-min`` and ``names-use-first`` attributes to
be set independently on ``cs:key``.

Ticket(s):

- |link| https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/82

Normalizing Initials in "long" Form Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new ``initialize`` attribute for ``cs:name`` can be set to "false" (the
default is "true") to stop ``initialize-with`` from activating name
initializing. However, in this case, the value of ``initialize-with`` is still
appended to initials present in the "long" form of names. For example,

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <names variable="author">
      <name initialize-with=". " initialize="false"/>
    </names>

reformats the names "James T Kirk" and "Hunter S. Thompson" to "James T. Kirk"
and "Hunter S. Thompson".

Specification
-------------

The CSL specification has been largely rewritten for improved precision and
clarity. There are several new paragraphs (e.g., |link| `Terminology
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#terminology>`_ and
|link| `File Types
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#file-types>`_), and
every `CSL variable
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#appendix-i-variables>`_
is now accompanied by a short description.

Style Metadata
--------------

eISSN
~~~~~

Previously, the ``cs:issn`` and ``cs:issnl`` elements could already be used to
indicate respectively the different ISSNs for journal-specific styles (e.g. of
the print and online editions), and the journal's ISSN-L. The new optional
``cs:eissn`` element allows the ISSN of the online edition (the eISSN) to be
explictly specified, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <info>
      <title>Applied and Environmental Microbiology</title>
      <issn>0099-2240</issn>
      <eissn>1098-5336</eissn>
    </info>

Ticket(s):

- |link| https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/51

License
~~~~~~~

The ``cs:rights`` element may now carry a ``license`` attribute to indicate the
URI of the style license, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <info>
      <rights license="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">This work
      is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported
      License</rights>
    </info>

Ticket(s):

- |link| https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/45

Short Title
~~~~~~~~~~~

The new optional ``cs:title-short`` element can be used to give a shortened
style title, e.g.:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <info>
      <title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</title>
      <title-short>PNAS</title-short>
    </info>

Ticket(s):

- |link| https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/83

Validation
----------

The schema has become slightly stricter when it comes to style validation. While
backward incompatible, the additional validation only concerns attributes that
had no use in CSL 1.0 styles.

Differences between Dependent and Independent Styles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For dependent styles, ``cs:style`` may no longer carry the ``default-locale``
attribute or any of the global options (the ``demote-non-dropping-particle``,
``initialize-with-hyphen``, and ``page-range-format`` attributes) and
inheritable name options, whereas the ``class`` attribute has become optional
(while ``class`` has no function in dependent styles, it will only be disallowed
in the next backward incompatible CSL release, as it's a required attribute for
CSL 1.0 styles).

In addition, the CSL schema has become more strict about the use of the ``rel``
attribute on ``cs:link``. The values "independent-parent" and "template" are now
only allowed for dependent and independent styles, respectively.

Ticket(s):

- |link| https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/39

No "verb" and "verb-short" Forms on Standalone ``cs:label``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is no longer allowed to set the ``form`` attribute to "verb" or "verb-short"
on standalone ``cs:label`` elements (these values are still allowed if
``cs:label`` is a child element of ``cs:names``).

Ticket(s):

- |link| https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/71

Variables
---------

Dedicated Variables "title" and "container-title" Abbreviations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, "title" and "container-title" abbreviations were only accessible
through the "short" forms of these variables. As a result, it was impossible to
specifically test whether an abbreviation existed (``<if variable="title"/>``
tests "true" whenever a "long" or "short" form of "title" exists).

Now, these abbreviations can also be accessed through the dedicated
"title-short" and "container-title-short" variables. For example,

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <choose>
      <if variable="title-short">
        <group delimiter=" ">
          <text variable="title-short"/>
          <text variable="title" prefix="(" suffix=")"/>
        </group>
      </if>
      <else>
        <text variable="title"/>
      </else>
    </choose>

would give title listings like:

  * The Hobbit (The Hobbit, or There and Back Again)
  * Lord of the Rings
  * Free Culture (Free Culture: The Nature and Future of Creativity)

More Number Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CSL variables "chapter-number", "collection-number" and "number-of-pages",
which previously were standard variables, have now become number variables. As a
result, they can now be rendered through either ``cs:number`` or ``cs:text``.

Ticket(s):

- |link| https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/issues/9

Using ``cs:label`` with Number Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cs:label`` element, which previously could only be used for the "locator"
and "page" variables (and name variables, when used as a child element of
``cs:names``), can now also be used with any |link| `number variable
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#number-variables>`_.
